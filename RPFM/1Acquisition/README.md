# Acquisition with Excite

Running the _Run.py_ file in this folder will launch Excite. Which will allow the user to specify a chirp and 
a measurement waveform, as described in the manual. The measurement waveform/chirp will be generated by an available
NI-6124 and the response will be acquired with the same card. Please refer to the manual for operation instructions.

The folder __Excite__ contains the Labview code and an executable which launches the Labview portion of Excite.

The bin folder contains all of the Python 3 code.
