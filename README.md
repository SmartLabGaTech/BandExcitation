# Resonant Piezoresponse Force Microscopy

A tool developed by the Smart Materials Advanced Research and Technology (SMART) lab at the Georgia Institute of Technology. This tool expands the functionality of any Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) to allow for wide bandwidth characterization of electromechanically active materials.

There are three folders:

  - __1Acquisition__: Contains the Python/Labview app that can be run on a National Instruments machine to collect data.
  - __2Fitting__: Contains a Python 3 Jupyter notebook which runs the SHO fitting process. Note requires bepy 1.0a5.
  - __3Analysis__: Contains a couple Python 3 Jupyter notebooks which demonstrate loading, plotting, and basic analysis of the SHO fitted data
